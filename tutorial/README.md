# Sklearn CRF tutorial

## Installation

First install the dependencies (including Jupyter):

```
pipenv install
```

Then start Jupyter inside the virtual environment:

```
pipenv run jupyter lab
```

And open the `tutorial.ipynb` file.


## Pre-trained models

I you want to skip the training steps (can take a while, as in... hours), you might want to move the `.pkl` files located in the `pre_trained` directory to the current one. The notebook will use these files instead of training its own models.

## Example of execution

The `output` directory contains an export of the notebook, so that you don't even have to run it yourself!
